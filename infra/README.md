# Infra

This folder will contain deployment and operational assets, such as:
- Dockerfiles and container build assets
- Compose or local orchestration files
- Monitoring/observability configuration
- Edge provisioning and bootstrap scripts

Principle: infrastructure as code with reproducible environments.
